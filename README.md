# Canadian largest robo advising firm - Wealthsimple

### Overview and Origin

Wealthsimple incorporated in September 2014 and the founder of the company is Michael Katchen who had worked for 1000Memories (a Silicon Valley-based startup) prior to founding Wealthsimple. The idea of Wealthsimple came from the time that Katchen worked in his previous company (1000Memories), he developed a spreadsheet with tips to help his colleagues set up investment portfolios by themselves without consulting with advisors which inspired the idea for Wealthsimple [^Heidi]. After the company was established, Katchen had an idea to make the investment simple which can be accessible for the vast majority. Katchen raised 2 million from 15 angel investors within two and half weeks in 2014 [^Mike] and he got $30 million from Power Financial in 2015 with two separate installments ($10 million in 2015 and $20 million 12 months after 1st installment) [^Quentin]. <br />
Power Financial was the major investor in the past few years with total investment of $265 million from 2015 to 2019 [^Clare] and became the primary owner of Wealthsimple with 77.4% holding shares [^Heidi]. <br />

## Business Activities
The founder’s idea for Wealthsimple was fully integrated into its business. It not only simplified the process of advisory by using algorithmic investment and saving programs (Alan, 2021) but also reduced the fee to the clients by digitalizing the documents and cutting the middleman (advisors) (Wealthsimple, 2021). As was mentioned on Wealthsimple website, 50% of the fees the clients paid were the advisors’ sales commissions at traditional wealth management firms and banks and those have huge back offices to support with traditional methods including paper documents for all legal and tracking purposes. Wealthsimple was a tech startup and it was managed cost efficiently in the way that it kept the cost to the minimum by introducing the most up-to-date technology. While it was hard for those traditional well established wealth management firms and banks to do so as they have many fixed costs  and legacy costs. <br />
Based on the review from Investopedia, Wealthsimple was a good fit for investors of all ages who were looking to save money (Alan, 2021). Its intended customers were millennials who were looking for full transparency in communication as well as socially responsible investing (Caroline, 2018). As of Q4 2021, Wealthsimple had 1.5 million Canadian clients with $15 billion assets under management. It has grown significantly, especially in 2021 due to the pandemic, people think more seriously about their financials by using digital technology (Noelle, 2021).  <br />
People chose Wealthsimple not only because it was the largest and leading robo advising firm in Canada, but also because it offered services that were not available in other Canadian robo advising firms. Below is a list of the unique services.<br />
- Halal investing (only available in Wealthsimple for robo advising (Andrew, 2022))
- Social Responsible investing (only available in Wealthsimple, WealthBar and ModernAdvisors for robo advising (Andrew, 2022))
- No minimum balance requirement (only available in Wealthsimple and NestWealth for robo advising (Andrew, 2022))
- Simple fees structure (only have two tiers of fee structures and no other hidden fees) (only available in Wealthsimple for robo advising firms (Andrew, 2022))<br /> 

As mentioned, Wealthsimple was a tech startup and all those leading offerings were supported by strong technologies. According to G2 Stack, Wealthsimple used 29 technologies for its products and services to build up the apps for trading, crypto, tax and Cash, which included HTML5, Google Analytics, and JQuery (Crunchbase, 2022). According to BuiltWith, Wealthsimple used 63 technologies for its website which included Viewport Meta, IPhone/Mobile Compatible and Google Font API (Crunchbase, 2022). According to Stackashare, Wealthsimple used 6 technologies in business operations, which included Slack, Jira, Zendesk and 1Password (Stackashare, 2022).<br />

## Landscape:

Wealthsimple has been a leading robo advising firm in Canada since 2014. As per Statista, total assets under management under robo advising firm was $297 billion global wide and $2.3 billion within Canada in 2017 and that it has increased significantly in the past 5 years to $1.4 trillion global wide and $16.5 billion in Canada in 2021 (Statista, 2021) which Wealthsimple reported $15 billion assets under management in Q4 2021 (Noelle, 2021). The assets under management per user increased in Canada from $8,210 in 2017 to $11,862 in 2021 while globally the assets under management per user declined from $7,000 in 2017 to $4,875 in 2021 (Statista, 2021). The increase in the assets under management per user in Canada indicated that more Canadians have adopted the robo advising with different levels of income and that wealthy families have adopted the robo advising significantly more to boost the average assets under management per user. It showed that Canadian robo advising firms had more potential to grow since it had penetrated to users from all classes. <br />
On the contrary, the number of users in the global market did not grow in the same way as it was in the Canadian market. Based on the global comparison, the majority of assets under management, $1 trillion out of $1.4 trillion, came from the USA (Statista, 2021). The decline in the assets under management per users indicated that globally, especially for the USA, users considered robo advising as a low cost substitute for traditional advising and that the users were concentrated at a lower income population. It might be a risk to the local robo advising firms that market shares could be maximized out. <br />
The growth for robo advising will double in the next 5 years from assets under management and in the number of users for Canada and globally. The assets under management per users will increase to $15k per users in Canada and $6k per users globally (Statista, 2021). <br />
As mentioned, Wealthsimple was the leading and largest robo advising firm in Canada. Other firms were much smaller with lower assets under management, such as Justwealth and VitualWealth. Two out of Five big banks invested in robo advising due to an increase in the trend. BMO introduced BMO smartfolio in 2016 which was marketed as an affordable digital portfolio management service (BMO, 2016). Moreover, BMO acquired Net Wealth (robo advising firms) in 2017 to expand its market share in Canada. Likewise, RBC launched RBC investEase in 2019 and provided the simplest portfolio for investors with a stable good performance (Michael, 2022); TD introduced TD Ameritrade Essential Portfolios in the USA in 2016 and had $1.6 billion assets under management as of June 2020 (Ryan, 2021). TD did not launch any robo advising platforms in Canada yet; however, if the trend continues to grow in Canada as Statista projected, TD will be likely to expand to Canada. <br />

Results

Wealthsimple was the leading and largest robo advising firm in Canada. It had great products and services at a low and simple fee structure as compared to other firms in Canada; however, Wealthsimple might not be as competitive  when they do business in the USA. <br />
As per global and mail, the top three robo advising firms were in the USA. They were Vanguard ($196.7 billion assets under management as of 2019), Wealthfront ($30.6 billion as of 2019) and Betterment ($23.4 billion assets under management as of 2019). As compared to Wealthsimple, it only had $6 billion assets under management in 2019 and the assets under management, which were far away from its competitors in the USA (Clare, 2020). <br />
Nerdwallet did a thorough review for Wealthsimple by highlighting Pros and Cons with its competitors outside Canada and by concluding the following two items that Wealthsimple needs to improve (Arielle, 2021).<br />

#### Account management fees:<br />
Wealthsimple provided lower and simple fee structure and leaded in Canada; however, when comparing to the top three robo advising firms in the USA, the management fee for Wealthsimple (0.5% management fee) was still high and it was double as much as that of those small robo advising firms, like Wealthfront and Betterment (0.25% management fee) (Alana, 2022). Moreover, even the big name brokers, such as TD Ameritrade Essential Portfolio (0.3% management fee) and Fidelity Go (0.35% management fee), had lower management fees than Wealthsimple. Therefore, it was hard for Wealthsimple to expand its market in the USA by competing with those local based Companies.<br />

#### Lack of personal finance tools:<br />
Wealthsimple provided great products and services for its clients; however, it had a limited number of international bonds, stocks and ETFs to choose from in its portfolio (Arielle, 2021). Moreover, from professional investors’ perspective, Wealthsimple did not have enough personal finance tools that help users to analyze and do the portfolio construction.Vise versa, from non-professional investors’ perspective, Wealthsimple did not have enough educational materials that provide guidelines to them (Arielle, 2021). On the contrary, its competitors, such as Wealthfront, Betterment and Vanguard, offered more products in the portfolio with clear guidelines to new investors since they have more experience from feedback of the large based users.<br />

Wealthsimple needs to study their weaknesses by comparing with large robo advising firms in the USA to improve their products and services and fee structure to gain more market share for expansion. <br />


## Recommendations
Based on the above discussion, Wealthsimple does not have competitive advantage for its expansion to the USA, it clearly indicated that Wealthsimple needs to reduce the account management fee or differentiate itself from its competitor to maintain current fee structure and add more products and services to both professional and non-professional investors for US market. <br />
A straight recommendation for Wealthsimple is to give up the US market for now and try to expand its market share only in Canada since Canadians from all classes are open and willing to adopt robo advising as per the discussion above (assets under management per users increase significantly from 2017 to 2021 (Statista, 2021)). The current products and services and the fee structures allow Wealthsimple to continue its leadership in the Canadian market. However, due to the trend of robo advising, Wealthsimple may lose its competitive advantage if the USA based robo advising firms expand to the Canadian market. TD Ameritrade Essential Portfolio is very successful in the USA and they are looking to move to Canada since they are a Canadian based company (IE staff, 2018).<br />
Another recommendation is with a more realistic approach. I suggest Wealthsimple to enhance the fee structures and add more products and services for both professional and non-professional investors to the extent that it aligns the features with its US competitors and on top of which Wealthsimple simplifies the process of to make those products and services more efficient as those products and services are presence in the market already. Wealthsimple can continue to expand its market in the USA by simplifying the process of the new products and services that they created to enhance its competitive advantage.<br />
I believe Wealthsimple can achieve the goal of expandation with either of the above recommendations with existing technologies that are being used and with all the innovations it is working on.. I believe Wealthsimple will continue to succeed in the future and always be the leader in the Canadian market. <br />
